abstract: 
  Mathematical modeling skills are essential for engineers to solve real-world problems. While
  there is a growing emphasis on pre-college engineering education, it remains unclear how
  pre-college students utilize and perceive mathematical modeling within the engineering design
  process. Engineering for US All (e4usa) is dedicated to crafting engineering courses for high
  school students with the goal of enhancing their understanding and skills in the field. In an early
  unit, e4usa introduced a mathematical modeling lesson based on MATLAB to assist students in
  simulating impurity removal by water filters. This paper explored the impact of MATLAB
  activities on students’ perspectives on modeling, offering insights for improving future
  engineering education programs.<br>
  
  This study is part of a broader research project about mathematical modeling in e4usa. The
  research team conducted surveys, classroom observations, and focus group interviews involving
  students and teachers participating during the 2022-2023 academic year. In this paper, we present
  our findings from student focus group data from two schools in different states. We aimed to
  summarize the emerging themes that described the impact of our intervention. Additionally, we
  coded the data based on the concepts of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT) to understand the learning
  process.<br>
  
  As a result, we found the benefits of mathematical modeling with MATLAB in helping them
  make scientifically informed engineering design decisions by allowing the testing of different
  materials and providing precise simulating results. However, challenges arose regarding the gap
  between simulation and prototype building. From the perspective of CLT, MATLAB helped
  reduce intrinsic load by minimizing prior knowledge requirements. Yet it was still crucial for
  managing multi-layered intrinsic loads and effectively dealing with extraneous loads.
  With the global advancement of technology and engineering, strengthening mathematical
  modeling skills for pre-college students has become increasingly important. This paper will
  contribute to the growing body of knowledge regarding how 21st-century students perceive
  mathematical modeling and provide insights for developing engineering courses.
