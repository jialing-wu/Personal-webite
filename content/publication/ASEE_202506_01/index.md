abstract: 
  **Background** Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields have increasingly highlighted the need to support minority groups to foster a more diverse and     equitable environment. While previous research has concentrated on female students in engineering, studies focusing on TGNC students are limited. Evidence indicates that TGNC students leave STEM disciplines at rates higher than or comparable to those of other marginalized groups./n
  
  **Purpose** This work-in-progress paper aims to investigate the impact of pre-college engineering courses on the self-efficacy of high school students, with a focus on Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming (TGNC) students, to advance a more equitable engineering education environment. /n
  
  **Methods** The study analyzed survey data collected from 788 students across 33 schools in 20 U.S. states and regions who participated in [Project Name REDACTED] courses in the 2022-23 academic year. Statistical analyses, including t-tests and ANOVA, were conducted to compare pre- and post- survey data, assess changes in self-efficacy and identify differences among male, female, and TGNC students./n
  
  **Results** Preliminary results reveal that while male and female students exhibited significant increases in self-efficacy after the course, TGNC students did not show similar gains. Additionally, TGNC students reported challenges in perceived support and barriers to pursue an engineering degree compared to male students./n
  
  **Conclusions** Engineering courses effectively enhance self-efficacy for male and female students but provide less pronounced benefits for TGNC students. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions and inclusive course designs to better support TGNC students. Future research will aggregate multi-year data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of these dynamics and inform strategies for fostering inclusivity in engineering education.
