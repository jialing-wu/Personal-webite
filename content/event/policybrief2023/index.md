title: Policy Brief of Integrated Engineering Education

event: Policy brief

summary: Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), Teacher Professional
abstract: 'Since the implementation of NGSS, studies have examined the role of TPD in integrating engineering. However, commonalities among these programs in aligning with NGSS remain unclear. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring how TPD facilitates NGSS in dimensions of 1) integrating engineering, 2) contextualizing student learning, and 3) real-world actions. Findings shows that TPD programs cover a range of topics, collaborate with experts, and link content to real-world challenges through designing lesson plans, utilizing teaching methods, and field studies. Practical sections enable teachers to emulate student learning with hands-on activities. The challenges in TPD include adapting projects to students' knowledge level, tailoring training materials, tracking transfer of experiences. Future programs should engage in cross-grade collaboration, design topics relevant to local resources, involve administrators, and include content to advise students on future STEM career development.'
