I am an Engineering Education Researcher currently pursuing my master degree in International Education Policy and Management at Vanderbilt Peabody College. I also hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai University, China. <br> 
<br>
Previously, I spent five years as a headhunter, recruiting leadership team members for companies in the field of education, consulting, finance, industries, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, I was a part-time volunteer at an NGO for migrant children. 
<br>
I am now serving as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Engineering for Us All](https://e4usa.org).
