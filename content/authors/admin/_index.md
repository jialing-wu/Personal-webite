I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Engineering Education at The Ohio State University. I earned my Master of Education at Vanderbilt University, Peabody College. I also hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai University, China. <br> 
<br>
Previously, I completed my summer internship with BioInteractive team (Science Education) at [Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)](https://www.biointeractive.org/). I also served as a Research Assistant at [Engineering for Us All](https://e4usa.org). From 2017 to 2022, I worked as a headhunter, recruiting leadership team members for companies in the field of education, consulting, finance, industry, and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, I served as a Program Coordinator and Volunteer Teacher at an NGO for migrant children in China.
